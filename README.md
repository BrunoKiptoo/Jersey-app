# Jersey-App

Problem Statement

Sports has been around for quite some time, and people have been free to go to their nearest stores to buy them and gift them to their loved ones. However, that is the past now. Due to the pandemic, many people have not been able to confidently go outside and shop for their favorite teams. To ensure that these clients are satisfied, developing a Sports' jersey delivery website is important. 

Solution

Create an online application/platform that allows users to order a variety of Jersey types with a same-day delivery option to the address of their loved ones at work, home, school (campus), or in the comfort of their homes or any place at a cheaper price.
The World Cup is One Month Away and There is no Better Way to Launch a Jersey App.
The App will target sports fanatics and will have have their favourite Jesrseys.
